./hsh
- Command line interpreter (shell)

The shell is executed by typing ./hsh

.br
Then, it will wait for an input such as : command [arguments] [other]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This shell is a project dedicated to our studies. My partners and I, have tried to mimic the behavior of a real shell. In case you don't know what a shell is (I doubt that) here is a brief explanation. A shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Our shell does not support the arguments passed to it.
B What hsh can do :
.br
- Executes any command with its arguments
.br
- Executes built-in commands
.br
The exit value depends on how a function has terminated. Every error is identified by a certain value. On success it will always return 0.br
.SH RETURN VALUE
Return 0 on success, otherwise it will return the exit value.
.br
There is no knocontador bugs at the moment.
.SH EXAMPLE
.B Two ways to execute our shell :
.br
.B The intercative mode :
.br
 $ ./hsh
.br
 #kmandmich$ /bin/ls
.br
 hsh main.c shell.c
.br
 #kmandmich$ exit
.br
 $
.br
.B The non-interactive mode :
.br
 $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
.br
 hsh function.c shell.c
